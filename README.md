Workshop 1: Raspberry Pi and IoT
================================

Objective:
===========

The purpose of this workshop is to get you started working with Bluemix,
Node-Red, Watson IoT, and a Raspberry Pi. You will be defining a
Raspberry Pi as an IoT device in the Watson IoT service. Following that,
you will use Node-Red to create an application on the Pi that reports
sensor information (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, etc.) to
another Node-Red application running on Bluemix. Two sets of
instructions are provided. If you have prior experience and would like
to try and complete the exercise on your own, follow the Jedi Master
path. Otherwise, if you prefer a more guided approach, choose the Jedi
Padowan path. Choose wisely and have fun.

### Total time to complete: 1.5 - 2 Hours

I.  Create the Bluemix Application Space (17 minutes)

II. Define IoT devices to Internet of Things Service (10 minutes)

III. Create dashDB table for environment data (8 minutes)

IV. Build Bluemix Node-Red flows (40 minutes)

V.  Connect to Raspberry Pi and Start Node-Red (5 minutes)

VI. Build Raspberry Pi Node-Red flows (40 minutes)

VII. Deploy and validate success (8 minutes)

***Note**: In the interest of time, it will be necessary to build the
Bluemix and Raspberry Pi Node-Red flows concurrently. One system will be
used to build the Bluemix portion, while another is used to build the
Raspberry Pi portion. During this time, all three team members should
work to oversee the overall project and provide each other guidance and
debugging support.*

Prerequisites:
==============

This workshop assumes that you have completed the STSA event
prerequisite activities. Specifically, you should have:

1.  An SSH terminal program for connecting to the Raspberry Pi. If you
    are using a MacOS or Linux based system, you are ready to go. If
    using Windows, you should have installed the PuTTY application
    available on the IBM Standard Software installer.

If you do not have these, please request assistance ASAP in order to get
your system prepared as you will not have time to complete the exercise.
