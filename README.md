# Raspberry Pi IoT Workshop

## Objective

The purpose of this workshop is to get you started working with IBM Cloud, Node-RED, Watson IoT, and a Raspberry Pi. You will be defining a Raspberry Pi as an IoT device in the Watson IoT service. Following tHat, you will use Node-RED to create an application on the Pi tHat reports sensor information (temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, etc.) to another Node-RED application running on IBM Cloud. Two sets of
instructions are provided. If you have prior experience and would like to try and complete the exercise on your own, follow the advanced
path. Otherwise, if you prefer a more guided approach, choose the guided path.

## Total time to complete: 1.5 - 2 Hours

1. Create an Internet of Things Platform service

2. Define the Raspberry Pi device to the IoT service

3. Create a Db2 Warehouse on Cloud service

4. Create a Db2 Warehouse table for environment data

5. Create a IBM Cloud Node-RED Application space

6. Create the Raspberry Pi Node-RED flows

7. Create the IBM Cloud Node-RED flows

8. Deploy and validate success

## Prerequisites

- You must have a [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com).

- You must have a Raspberry Pi and a Sense Hat.

- You must be able to connect to your Raspberry Pi on a network and you need to know itâ€™s ip address or hostname.

- The Node.js and Node-RED on the Raspberry Pi must be updated by running the command: update-nodejs-and-nodered in a terminal on the Raspberry Pi.

- You should have an ssh terminal program for connecting to the Raspberry Pi. If you are using a MacOS or Linux system, you are ready to go. If you are using a Windows system, install the PuTTY application, which is available at <http://www.putty.org> Software installer.
